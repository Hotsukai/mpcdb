It contains 90 musical performances by 9 players and 239 critique documents written by 12 teachers.The qualitative knowledge of what kind of 'words' is used in the musical performance tuition to become professionals is not widely shared.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
